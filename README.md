let's go with DSA
 Hey Guys ,what's up ,, i know that nowadays companies are increasing the level of questions in their round,,and employees or students are not able to solve them and 99% of them fail the interviews. The reason for this is that the lack of practice,,as we know that they are solving leetcode problems,,but they don't know the actual concepts to solve the questions,,as it's not necessary to showoff the number of questions on your resume. If you want to crack the interview and to be eligible at the good companies ,I am providing the following links of GFG.
