Hello everyone! 👋
    I hope you're all doing well. Nowadays, it's becoming increasingly challenging to excel in job interviews and examinations as companies and educational institutions are raising the bar with tougher questions. In fact, many talented individuals find themselves struggling and failing to secure the positions they desire.                                                                                               One key factor contributing to this struggle is the lack of adequate preparation. While it's common for people to focus on solving LeetCode problems, it's equally important to understand the underlying concepts that enable you to tackle a wide range of questions effectively. Remember, it's not about showcasing the sheer number of problems you've solved on your resume; it's about having a deep understanding of the subject matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                     To help you succeed in interviews and examinations, I'd like to share some valuable resources from GeeksforGeeks (GFG). These resources can provide you with the knowledge and skills needed to crack interviews at top-notch companies and perform exceptionally well in your academic pursuits.
